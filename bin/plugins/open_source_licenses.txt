The following is applicable to Md5:

This code implements the MD5 message-digest algorithm.

The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest. This code was written by
Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.

This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.

Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.

This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,
except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese with
every copy.

To compute the message digest of a chunk of bytes, declare an
MD5Context structure, pass it to MD5Init, call MD5Update as
needed on buffers full of bytes, and then call MD5Final, which
will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the digest.

money off of it, good for you. I kinda like capitalism. Please

Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK
IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE
OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR
COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT
AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR
GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR
ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

   a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue,
      anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its
      entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other
      contributions, constituting separate and independent works
      in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole.  A
      work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
      considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the
      purposes of this License.

   b. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon
      the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a
      translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
      fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording,
      art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other
      form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or
      adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective
      Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the
      purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where
      the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the
      synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving
      image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for
      the purpose of this License.

   c. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the
      Work under the terms of this License.

   d. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who
      created the Work.

   e. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered
       under the terms of this License.

   f. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under
      this License who has not previously violated the terms of
      this License with respect to the Work, or who has received
      express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights
      under this License despite a previous violation.

   g. "License Elements" means the following high-level license
      attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the
      title of this License: Attribution, ShareAlike.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to
   reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use,
   first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the
   copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
   License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
   non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
   copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as
   stated below:

   a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or
      more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated
      in the Collective Works;

   b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;

   c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly,
      perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
      digital audio transmission the Work including as
      incorporated in Collective Works;

   d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly,
      perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a
      digital audio transmission Derivative Works.

   e. For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical
      composition:

      i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor
         waives the exclusive right to collect, whether
         individually or via a performance rights society
         (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public
         performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast)
         of the Work.

     ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor
         waives the exclusive right to collect, whether
         individually or via a music rights society or designated
         agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any
         phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version")
         and distribute, subject to the compulsory license
         created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act
         (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).

   f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the
      avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording,
      Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether
      individually or via a performance-rights society
      (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital
      performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the
      compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US
      Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats
whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include
the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary
to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not
expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is
   expressly made subject to and limited by the following
   restrictions:

   a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
      publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of
      this License, and You must include a copy of, or the
      Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every
      copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly
      display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
      perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
      that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the
      recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You
      may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all
      notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
      warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display,
      publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work
      with any technological measures that control access or use
      of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
      License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as
      incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not
      require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to
      be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create
      a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must,
      to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work
      any credit as required by clause 4(c), as requested. If You
      create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You
      must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative
      Work any credit as required by clause 4(c), as requested.

   b. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
      publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the
      terms of this License, a later version of this License with
      the same License Elements as this License, or a Creative
      Commons iCommons license that contains the same License
      Elements as this License (e.g.  Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5
      Japan). You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
      Identifier for, this License or other license specified in
      the previous sentence with every copy or phonorecord of
      each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly display,
      publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform.  You may
      not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that
      alter or restrict the terms of this License or the
      recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder, and
      You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License
      and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not
      distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
      digitally perform the Derivative Work with any
      technological measures that control access or use of the
      Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
      License Agreement. The above applies to the Derivative Work
      as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not
      require the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work
      itself to be made subject to the terms of this License.

   c. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
      publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works
      or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright
      notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium
      or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original
      Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or
      (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate
      another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute,
      publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's
      copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
      means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the
      Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the
      Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor
      specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI
      does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
      information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative
      Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the
      Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
      Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by
      Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any
      reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
      Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such
      credit will appear where any other comparable authorship
      credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as
      such other comparable authorship credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer.  UNLESS OTHERWISE
   AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK
   AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
   CONCERNING THE MATERIALS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR
   OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE,
   MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
   NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
   ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
   DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
   IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
   APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON
   ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
   PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR
   THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
      terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms
      of this License. Individuals or entities who have received
      Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this
      License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
      provided such individuals or entities remain in full
      compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and
      8 will survive any termination of this License.

   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license
      granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the
      applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the
      above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
      under different license terms or to stop distributing the
      Work at any time; provided, however that any such election
      will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
      license that has been, or is required to be, granted under
      the terms of this License), and this License will continue
      in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the
      Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the
      recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and
      conditions as the license granted to You under this
      License.

   b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a
      Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
      original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted
      to You under this License.

   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
      under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
      enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,
      and without further action by the parties to this agreement,
      such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
      to make such provision valid and enforceable.

   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and
      no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be
      in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such
      waiver or consent.

   e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the
      parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are
      no understandings, agreements or representations with
      respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not
      be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in
      any communication from You. This License may not be
      modified without the mutual written agreement of the
      Licensor and You.

Both licenses are included here. Some of the standalone binaries

tools/dbus-cleanup-sockets.c and test/decode-gcov.c. Each source
code file is marked with the proper copyright information - if
you find a file that isn't marked please bring it to our
attention.

[VMware opts to use and distribute D-BUS under the terms of the
Academic  Free License v. 2.1 as noted below.]

The Academic Free License v. 2.1

This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any
original work of authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner
(the "Licensor") has placed the following notice immediately
following the copyright notice for the Original Work:

Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1

1. Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
   royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable
   license to do the following:

   a. to reproduce the Original Work in copies;

   b. to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original
      Work;

   c. to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the
      public;

   d. to perform the Original Work publicly; and

   e. to display the Original Work publicly.

2. Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
   royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under
   patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in
   the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and
   offer for sale the Original Work and Derivative Works.

3. Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the
   preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications
   to it and all available documentation describing how to modify
   the Original Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a
   machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work
   along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor
   distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this
   obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source
   Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to
   permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as
   Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by
   publishing the address of that information repository in a
   notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies
   to the Original Work.

4. Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor,
   nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor
   any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to
   endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work
   without express prior written permission of the
   Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any
   rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or
   any other intellectual property of Licensor except as
   expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make,
   use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims
   other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No right
   is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks
   are included in the Original Work.  Nothing in this License
   shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under
   different terms from this License any Original Work that
   Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

5. This section intentionally omitted.

6. Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any
   Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or
   trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work,
   as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text
   identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause
   the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to
   carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to
   inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.

7. Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor
   warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and
   the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the
   Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this
   License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those
   copyrights and patent rights.  Except as expressly stated in
   the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original Work is
   provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT
   WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without
   limitation, the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT,
   MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
   ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH
   YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part
   of this License. No license to Original Work is granted
   hereunder except under this disclaimer.

8. Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no
   legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
   contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any
   person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
   consequential damages of any character arising as a result of
   this License or the use of the Original Work including,
   without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work
   stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of
   liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal
   injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to the extent
   applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions
   do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may
   not apply to You.

9. Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the
   Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable
   effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of
   recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing else but this
   License (or another written agreement between Licensor and
   You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based
   upon the Original Work or to exercise any of the rights
   granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do so except
   under the terms of this License (or another written agreement
   between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by
   U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries,
   and by international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of
   the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate
   Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and
   conditions.

10. Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate
    automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the
    rights granted to You by this License as of the date You
    commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim,
    against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original
    Work infringes a patent.  This termination provision shall
    not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by
    combinations of the Original Work with other software or
    hardware.

11. Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit
    relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
    a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which
    Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of
    that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law
    provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention
    on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
    excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of
    this License or after its termination shall be subject to the
    requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17
    U.S.C. &#130; 101 et seq., the equivalent laws of other
    countries, and international treaty. This section shall
    survive the termination of this License.

12. Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this
    License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing
    party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses,
    including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
    costs incurred in connection with such action, including any
    appeal of such action. This section shall survive the
    termination of this License.

13. Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement
    concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of
    this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision
    shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

14. Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this
    License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual
    or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with
    all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, "You"
    includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is
    under common control with you. For purposes of this
    definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or
    indirect, to cause the direction or management of such
    entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership
    of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or
    (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

15. Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not
    otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by
    law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be
    responsible for such uses by You.

Introduction
============

  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
  FreeType Project.

  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test programs,
  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.

  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and IJG
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware products
  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:

    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)

    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)

    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used the
      FreeType code. (`credits')

  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of this
  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project and
  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.


  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form for  a
  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
  encourage you to use the following text:

   """
    Portions of this software are copyright (c) <year> The FreeType
    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
   """

  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
  actually use.


Legal Terms
===========

0. Definitions
--------------

  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files originally
  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm, and
  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
  beta or final release.

  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the FreeType
  engine'.

  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries and
  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in its
  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
  this license, you must contact us to verify this.

  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
  specified below.

1. No Warranty
--------------

  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.

2. Redistribution
-----------------

  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual and
  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute and
  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and to
  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
  herein, subject to the following conditions:

    o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
      (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
      the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
      documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the unaltered,
      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of source
      files.

    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer that
      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in your
      documentation, though this isn't mandatory.

  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or based on
  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
  to us.

3. Advertising
--------------

  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
  purposes without specific prior written permission.

  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.

  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not required to
  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is copyrighted
  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the FreeType
  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
  of this license.

4. Contacts
-----------

  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:

    o freetype@nongnu.org

      Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as
      future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.
      If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you
      haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.

    o freetype-devel@nongnu.org

      Discusses bugs,  as well  as engine internals,  design issues,
      specific licenses, porting, etc.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--
to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General
Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's
software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.
(Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the
GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,
not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make
sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free
software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you
receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can
change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs;
and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you
if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights
that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can
get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission
to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for
this free software. If the software is modified by someone else
and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have
is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will
not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making
the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear
that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not
licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into
another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without
limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Program (independent of having been made by running the
Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy
of this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of
Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:


a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or
any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to
all third parties under the terms of this License.

c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive
use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement
including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there
is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and
that users may redistribute the program under these conditions,
and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
(Exception:
if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print
such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not
required to print an announcement.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and
separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,
do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
separate works. But when you distribute the same sections
as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the
distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,
whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,
and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather,
the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution
of derivative or collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program)
on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
the other work under the scope of this License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
following:

a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
or,

b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received
the program in object code or executable form with such an offer,
in accord with Subsection b above.)
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable. However,
as a special exception, the source code distributed need not
include anything that is normally distributed (in either source
or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and
so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,
unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are
not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program
is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated
so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so,
and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or
modifying the Program or works based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based
on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license
from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the
Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not
impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of
the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties to this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to
patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court
order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of
this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not
permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those
who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the
only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
ntegrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
willing to distribute software through any other system and a
licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted
in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted
only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case,
this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
body of this License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or
new versions of the General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program
does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by
the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;
we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided
by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives
of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of s
oftware generally.

NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
OR CORRECTION.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO
YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

GNU Lesser General Public License

Version 2.1, February 1999


Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General
Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share
and change free software--to make sure the software is free for
all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of
the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use
it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully
about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License
is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the
explanations below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure
that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software
(and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source
code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software
and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed
that you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender
these rights. These restrictions translate to certain
responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library
or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can
get the source code. If you link other code with the library,
you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that
they can relink them with the library after making changes to the
library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so
they know their rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright
the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you
legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library
is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should
know that what they have is not the original version, so that
the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems
that might be introduced by others.

Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence
of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining
a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we
insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the
library must be consistent with the full freedom of use
specified in this license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the
GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated
libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public
License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to
permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically
or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally
speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.
The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such
linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of
freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax
criteria for linking other code with the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because
it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary
General Public License. It also provides other free software
developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs.
These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General
Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license
provides advantages in certain special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that
it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free
programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent
case is that a free library does the same job as widely used
non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by
limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the
Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in
non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use
a large body of free software. For example, permission to use
the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people
to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant,
the GNU/Linux operating system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective
of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program
that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal
to run that program using a modified version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between
a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".
The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter
must be combined with the library in order to run.


TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms
of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
compilation and installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act
of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output
from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a
work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in
a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the
Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of
any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with
the Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:


a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
   stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge
   to all third parties under the terms of this License.
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
   table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the
   facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is
   invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
   in the event an application does not supply such function or table,
   the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its
   purpose remains meaningful.
   (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
   a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.
   Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application- supplied
   function or table used by this function must be optional: if the
   application does not supply it, the square root function must still
   compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a
volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other
work under the scope of this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of
the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can
specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other
change in these notices.

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the
Library into a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative
of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with
the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must
be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled
or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because
it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses
the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be
a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is
not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work
can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a
library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely
defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered
by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the
work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include
the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a
reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you
must do one of these things:


a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine- readable
   source code for the Library including whatever changes were used
   in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2
   above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library,
   with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library",
   as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify
   the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable
   containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user
   who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will
   not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the
   modified definitions.)
b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
   Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
   copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
   rather than copying library functions into the executable, and
   (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library,
   if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
   interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least
   three years, to give the same user the materials specified in
   Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
   performing this distribution.
d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
   from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
   specified materials from the same place.
e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
   materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
   Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
   reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
   the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
   normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
   components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
   which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
   the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted,
and provided that you do these two things:


a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This
   must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that
   part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to
   find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you
under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as
such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so,
and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the
Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose
any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
by third parties with this License.

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do
not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example,
if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of
the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section
is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended
to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe
any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity
of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
the integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of
that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
she is willing to distribute software through any other system
and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted
in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
the original copyright holder who places the Library under this
License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted
only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case,
this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library specifies a version number of this License which applies
to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library
does not specify a license version number, you may choose any
version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other
free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible
with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For
software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two
goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our
free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software
generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS
NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the
greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free
software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so
by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively,
under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full
notice is found.

one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.

		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
your libraries, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.


  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
the same as in the ordinary license.

  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
treats it as such.

  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
will lead to faster development of free libraries.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
works together with the library.

  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.


		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.


  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.


  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.


  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.


  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.


  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.


  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS


           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Library General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301 USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random
Hacker.

			 The "Artistic License"

				Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

	"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
	Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
	created through textual modification.

	"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
	modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
	of the Copyright Holder as specified below.

	"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
	copyrights for the package.

	"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
	this Package.

	"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the
	basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
	and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the
	Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large
	as a market that must bear the fee.)

	"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
	itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
	It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
	under the same conditions they received it.

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package
modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
following:

    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
    an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
    site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
    your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
    with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
    a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
    documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
    together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
    to get the Standard Version.

    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
    the Package with your modifications.

    c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
    document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
    with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However,
you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software
distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
product of your own.  You may embed this Package's interpreter within
an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere
form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the
interpreter is so embedded.

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated
them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a
binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do
not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
Package.

7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other
languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
regression tests for the language.

8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,
when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible
to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be
construed as a distribution of this Package.

9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
products derived from this software without specific prior
written permission.

10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.
